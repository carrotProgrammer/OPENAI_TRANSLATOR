ǂđʭ ̗ Virtual pedagogical agents can be used to motivate online learners, to provide
Project affective and mental support during self-studying, and to improve the overall
description online learning experience. The integration of pedagogical agents in virtual
learning environments is highly desirable, but their exact impact is yet to be
assessed. The aim of the project is to further the understanding of the effect that
pedagogical agents have on the learning experience of students. You will examine
how students perceive the role of pedagogical agents as learning companions
during specific learning activities and the effect that their assistance has on their
overall learning experience. The goal is to equip virtual pedagogical agents with
the ability to interact with the student and to respond to the student’s affective and
mental states through appropriate expressive motions and motivational behaviours.
The project entails to first evaluate some existing pedagogical agents using user
experiments (e.g., Wizard-of-Oz type experiments) and questionnaires, paying
particular attention to aspects such as appearance, expressivity, interpretability,
transparency, trust and potential for bonding. You will then propose new designs
to address your evaluation findings, implement (e.g., in Blender and Unity 3D),
deploy and evaluate the new pedagogical agents.

ǂđʭ ̗虚拟教育代理人可以用来激发在线学习者的学习动力，提供在自学过程中的情感和心理支持，并改善整体的在线学习体验。集成教育代理人到虚拟学习环境中非常有前景，但他们的确切影响尚待评估。该项目的目标是进一步了解教育代理人对学生学习体验的影响。您将研究学生如何感知教育代理人在特定学习活动中作为学习伴侣的角色，以及他们的帮助对整体学习体验的影响。目标是使虚拟教育代理人能够与学生互动，并通过适当的表情和激励行为回应学生的情感和心理状态。该项目首先涉及使用用户实验（例如，Wizard-of-Oz类型实验）和问卷评估一些现有的教育代理人，特别关注外观、表达能力、可解释性、透明度、信任和建立潜力等方面。然后，您将提出新的设计来解决评估结果，实施（例如，在Blender和Unity 3D中），部署并评估新的教育代理人。
